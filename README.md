Demo: https://branu-ws.github.io/v-drag/

### Installation

npm:
```bash
npm install @branu-jp/v-drag
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add @branu-jp/v-drag --save
```

### Use

Node.js env (such a `.vue` components):

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <div style="position: absolute;" v-drag>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import drag from '@branu-jp/v-drag'

export default {
  directives: {
    drag
  }
}
</script>
```

Browser env: __coming soon__.


### Notes

An element with `v-drag` must have `position: absolute;` to be draggable.

### Options

You may desire only one part of an element to be `draggable`. You can achieve this by passing a string which referes to an `id` as argument to `v-drag`.

```html
<div id="header">
  <div v-drag:header>
    <div>
      Some text
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This will result in any area that is not `<div id="header"`> not becoming draggable. One common use case is a modal, that is only draggable when the top area is clicked.

You can constrain the draggable object from leaving the viewpor by using the `window-only` modifier like so:

```html
<div v-drag.window-only>
  This element cannot be dragged outside the window
</div>
```
